    // One difference between OpenGL and D3D is that in D3D, pixels are centered on integers, whereas
    //   in OpenGL, they're on half-integer coordinates. Originally, this function finished with a glTranslatef
    //   call to account for this, but OpenGL seems to be very finicky with rasterizing edges on pixel centers,
    //   and most positions in EoSD do use whole integer coordinates for edges (D3D seems to be less
    //   finicky about rasterization). To prevent obvious off-by-one errors with edges in the UI, no accounting
    //   is done for the pixel coordinate discrepancy aside from changing the rounding in DrawOrthographic, if
    //   applied, to use whole integers (OpenGL pixel boundaries), rather than half integers (D3D pixel boundaries).
    //   Graphical output should really be checked thoroughly to make sure nothing (especially in the 3D draw functions)
    //   ends up a half pixel off.
